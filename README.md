## Notebook App README

Implement a Notebook application using techniques you have learnt in the first two weeks of the course:

Domain Modelling
Test-driven development
Refactoring your code to use OOD
Giving and receiving feedback

More information here: https://hackmd.io/AE2OB1cqRP2F6SU-OW2ERw?view

Evidence Plan
Ask your pair for feedback on your code.

Things to consider:
- Are tests isolated?
- Are all tests meaningful?
- Are the test descriptions clear?
- Has a consistent TDD process been followed? How could you tell?

###Domain Modelling
I have attempted to create a model which was used to plan how this app will work and how the code will be written. See below (*post digital version once complete*)

###Test-driven development
A test was written for every expected action before the code was written.

###ODD Refactoring

###Giving and receiving feedback
